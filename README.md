Two Covid Datasets (JSON format) were used to extract data.

Dataset - 1: -
https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/data.min.json

DataSet - 2: -
https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/timeseries.min.json

I used Python to extract the data and convert it into csv format from the json files.
Used Python Libraries: - Pandas, Requests, Numpy, and JSON

PFA related file of data extraction: - (“Covid_Project_json_to_csv.ipynb”)

Used Pandas for Data cleaning and handling null values. 

Used SQL and Excel to get insights from those tables. “Covid_Project.sql” file contains all sql
queries used to derive insights.

Also used some statistics for getting some statistical insights like recovery rate, rates of deaths,
Etc and plotted the required graphs using Excel.

"main_dashboard.xlsx" file contains the summarised Dashboard. There are multiple
dashboards in this file which are interactive.Dashboard were made using Excel.

"project_presenation" file contains the presentation of all the data derived and anaysis of the data.
