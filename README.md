OBJECTIVE :

The project's goal is to develop an interactive dashboard for in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data across Indian states, offering valuable insights for users to explore various timeframes and pandemic-related features interactively.


TECH STACKS :

Python | SQL | Excel | MS PowerPoint


DATA DESCRIPTION:

Used official COVID-19 India API.

Dataset 1:
https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/data.min.json

Dataset 2:
https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/timeseries.min.json


DATA CLEANING/PREPROCESSING :

1. Utilized Python libraries including Pandas, JSON, and Requests to extract API data and convert it into a CSV format.
2. Conducted data cleaning, addressing null values and noise in the dataset.
3. Generated separate CSV files for state, district, and time-series data and conducted a comprehensive analysis using SQL.


DASHBOARD :

Imported data into Excel and crafted an interactive Excel Dashboard, leveraging pivot tables, diverse Excel formulas, slicers, themes, charts, formatting, and more.
