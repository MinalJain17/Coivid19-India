# Objective

The project's goal is to develop an interactive dashboard for in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data across Indian states, offering valuable insights for users to explore various timeframes and pandemic-related features interactively.


# Tech Stack

Python | SQL | Excel | MS PowerPoint


# Data Description

Used official COVID-19 India API.

Dataset 1:
https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/data.min.json

Dataset 2:
https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/timeseries.min.json


# Data preprocessing

1. Utilized Python libraries including Pandas, JSON, and Requests to extract API data and convert it into a CSV format.
